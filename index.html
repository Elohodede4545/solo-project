                   <strong>MAKOKO VILLAGE</strong><br>
                    Makoko is situated on Lagos mainland, Nigeria. It is a large low-income community with half the population on water and half on land.
                    The houses on water are built from hardwood, supported by wood stilts driven deep into the waterbed. Each house usually houses between 
                    six to ten people and a high percentage are rental properties. The waters are five feet deep.
                    A great place for a tourist visit.
